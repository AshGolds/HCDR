# HomeCredit Default Risk Prediction
## **Project Overview**
Home Credit provides loans to customers with limited or unusual credit histories. To support better risk management, this project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of loan default. The objective is to minimize financial loss while expanding access to qualified applicants.

## **Solution Summary**
The project involved conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineering new features, and training multiple machine learning models. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models were evaluated. The final model was selected based on AUC-ROC performance and business interpretability.

## **Contributions**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis and missing value treatment.

- Engineered new features to strengthen model inputs.

- Trained and evaluated baseline and advanced machine learning models.

- Fine-tuned model to maximize generalization of new data without compromising accuracy.

- Created visual summaries and business-focused analysis outputs.

## **Business Value**
The final model improves Home Creditâ€™s risk prediction capabilities, reducing default rates and supporting expansion into underserved lending markets. It provides a practical tool for decision-makers to optimize loan approvals and risk management strategies.

## **Challenges Faced**
- Addressing heavy class imbalance between default and non-default borrowers.

- Managing missing and inconsistent data across large datasets.

- Ensuring model results are interpretable and actionable for business use.

## **Key Learnings**
- Key technical and analytical skills strengthened during the project include:

- Managing incomplete and imbalanced datasets.

- Engineering features to improve predictive power.

- Balancing model performance with real-world business constraints.

- Structuring analysis for both technical and non-technical audiences.
